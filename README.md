# Overview
This program is made to practice different aspects of the C# language. The CalculatorFunctions program
is a calculator type program that is capable of performing different types of functions to the user.
It runs simpler functions as well as more complex problems like the Fibonacci Sequence. The program also
includes some formulas as well, like for calculating the area of a shape.

# Development Environment
This program was made using the C# language in the Visual Studio Community IDE. This IDE has been very
helpful in regards to debugging and finding ways that a program went wrong with its errors.

# Future Work

- Being a calculator program, there are all kinds of formulas that can be added to
  this program. It would just depend on what formulas would need to be added
- Something that would need to be improved upon with this program is error checking.
  Right now, the program trusts that the user will always input something within the desired range.
- There are probably more efficient ways to implement these functions, 
  and that is something that Iwill research to make the program run smoother.
